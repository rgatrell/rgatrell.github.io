            Cats can be found all over the world, whether in the wild, or as a household pet. For many centuries, cats have been PURR-aised for their nature and abilities in the wild, as well as thier seemless integration into our everyday lives. In ancient Egypt, cats were seen as PURR-fect, and often depicted as dieties.

            Though cats are loved by most, there is still lots of superstition aroudn them and their supposed 'bad luck.'
